<h2>Minishell</h2>

Minishell is a second project system (UNIX) branch at 42. The purpose of this project is to learn and have a good understanding of process creation and synchronisation in C. Executing a command inside a shell implies creating a new process, which execution and final state will be monitored by its parentâ€™s process.

For this project, I implemented: cd, setenv, usetenv, env, echo, exit, pwd, clear as well as multiple commands management.
